Learning how the system works

I'm looking into the possibility of eventually switching careers from biochemistry back to programming.  I did do web design and programming about 10 years ago, but I lost interest in the business side.  At the moment, I'm auditing HarvardX's CS50 course as a basic refresher to progranming concepts.
